# MSc-smallprojects
A collection of small projects from my Master's Medical Informatics (University of Amsterdam)

### Data science medicine
* Data science: an assignment about data (pre)processing
* Regression and Prediction: training a multivariate regression model with risk factors of CVD to predict a CVD event
* SVM and Random Forest: Comparing the performance of SVM and RF and a NN on a simulatedConcentrations dataset
* Prediction Models (in R): Train prediction models on the BreastCancer dataset, also contains bootstrapping, AUC & NRI, StepAIC. 

### Data analysis medicine
* Mathematical Statistics: calculate the cost-efficacy ratio of a dataset and its 95% confidence interval, as well as a mathematical proof for the variance.
* Renal Transplantation (in R): Cox regression analysis to predict graft failure.
* Aorta Diameter Growth (in R): Mixed-effects regression model showing predictions with new data (new patients and new time points). 
* Kidney Transplant (in R): Joining a cox regression model and a LME model for predictive value of repeated measures for graft and patient failure.
